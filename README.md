Data Science Mini Projects
This repository showcases a collection of small but impactful data science projects built using Python.
Each project focuses on practical problem-solving and demonstrates data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills, with some automation and dashboard-ready outputs.

Projects Included
1. Covid-19 Analysis Dashboard
Goal: Perform time-series & geographic analysis of Covid-19 cases in India.

Tech: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Tableau-ready processed dataset.

Highlights:

Aggregated state-wise & daily case data.

Exported clean data for interactive dashboard creation in Tableau.

2. Social Progress Index Analysis
Goal: Analyze global Social Progress Index (SPI) data and uncover correlations between education, healthcare, sustainability, and SPI scores.

Tech: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib).

Highlights:

Built correlation heatmaps and rank-based comparisons.

Visualized top & bottom 10 countries by SPI score.

3. Inventory Alert System
Goal: Build an automation script to track stock levels and flag items below a threshold.

Tech: Python (Pandas, Excel integration).

Highlights:

Generates real-time low-stock alerts in the console.

Exports low-stock data to Excel for easy reporting.

Tech Stack
Languages: Python 3

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, OpenPyXL (for Excel)

Visualization: Tableau (for Covid-19 Dashboard)
